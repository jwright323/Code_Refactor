# Horizon (Code Re-factor)
This week, I have been tasked with cleaning up the code for a search engine optimization company called Horiseon. Issues that I was tasked with was making the code flow more concisely when reading (from a dev POV), while still preserving the external functions of the website (what end users see when navigating to the site).

# Task Description
This job was to make the HTML side of the webpage more semantically sound as well as applying the applicable changes to the CSS side of things as well.
