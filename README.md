# Horiseon (Code Refactor)
This week, I have been tasked with cleaning up the code for a search engine optimization company called Horiseon. Issues that I was tasked with was making the code flow more concisely when reading (from a dev POV), while still preserving the external functions of the website (what end users see when navigating to the site).

# Task Description
The nature of this task was to make the HTML side of the webpage more semantically sound as well as applying the applicable changes to the CSS side of things as well.

# Tools Used to Complete Task
* HTML
* CSS
* Visual Studio Code
* Google Fu!
  
# Acceptance Criteria
* Replace existing html tags with logically ordered, semantic html tags
* Add alt attributes to all image tags/elements
* Inside of the 'title' tag, insert descriptive content, like the name or purpose of the site
* Heading elements should appear with the largest (e.g.'h1') at the top of the file and the lower headings should be below in the html page
* Add comments to notate what each section of code was performing (HTML & CSS)
